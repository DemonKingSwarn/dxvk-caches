# dxvk-caches
DXVK caches to reduce stuttering!

**Feel free to contribute caches of new games or for merge with existing ones!**

For merging I'm using: https://github.com/DarkTigrus/dxvk-cache-tool

**How to:**

Extract .tar.xz file to get .dxvk-cache

Wine:
next to .exe or specified path with env variable.

Steam: `/path/to/steamapps/shadercache/1237970/DXVK_state_cache` default is `~/.local/share/..` or next to .exe if shader pre-caching is turned off.
